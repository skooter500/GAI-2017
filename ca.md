# Game Engines 2 Assignment 2017

For this assignment, I want you to use all the game AI techniques you can think of to make a fantastic and beautiful creature (or system of creatures) and bring it to life. The creature should be made procedurally and should be animated and be able to navigate it's environment and also interact with the player. In addition, it should have have complex high level behaviours, motivations, goals and emotions. If you are making a school of creatures then they should interact with each other in a realistic way. Techniques you can use:

- Steering behaviours
- Analytical geometry
- Sound
- Procedural animation
- Procedural generation from maths and algorithms
- State machines
- Behaviour trees
- Goal directed agent AI

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | The animation looks fantastic and complex with convinving, realistic creature movement through a complex environment. Your creature interacts with its environment, other creatures and the player. You might have taken inspiration from a real creature and your creation bears a close resemblance to it. Your creature has convincingly realistic high level goals and behaviours and appears alive and unpredictable. You have developed your own framework of well designed AI code that uses polymorphism, interfaces and appropriate design patterns to maximise code reuse and flexibility. You code is flexible enough to be used to program different types of creatures. You have researched and are using a number of AI techniques that significantly expand on the techniques we learned in the class.  You made a pull request on Forms to contribute your code back to the course. The creature is made procedurally or alternatively you have made a skinned mesh in Blender and animated it procedurally. The colour scheme and art style are appropriate. Your assignment has polish. Your git repo is well documented with video examples, a build and instructions for compilation and use. Your work is of a standard that you would consider submitting it to the Unity Asset Store. You demo your assignment with pride at DubLudo. |
| 2.1 | The animation looks good though less complex. The creature will interact with the player. Most of the techniques you used, you learned on the course. You creature has high level behaviours based on state machines with enumerated types or co-routines and after a while, it's behaviour might become predictable and occasionally unrealistic. Your code is organised into components that promote reuse. You will have use geometric primitives, random colours or just a single colour and laid out your creature using the Unity editor. Your git repo will have a video demo and instructions for use. |
| 2.2 | The creature is probably not animated or the animation might not be tied to the creature movement, creating some unrealism. Movement and animation have significant glitches. You might have used assets from the asset store or lots of code we developed on the course and not modified too much. You will have implemented some steering behaviours, but maybe no high level behaviours or simple high level behaviours based on colliders and triggers or C# logic.  The creature design will be geometric primitives laid out using the Unity editor, or a 3D model that you found online. Your git repo has no video or documentation. |
| Pass | A basic steering behaviour simulation that was completed in a few hours. About the level of complexity of one of our labs. All your code and assets are geometric primitives, or modeuls found online. Significant unresolved issues |
